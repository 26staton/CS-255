System Analysis and Design
DriverPass is a new company that is developing a strategy to help inexperienced drivers get better prepared for their written and behind-the-wheel exams. They provide access to a variety of resources, including online practice tests as well as in-person driver education seminars. These benefits are accessible by using a mobile application that is web-based and is available to users. We were entrusted with designing an application by DriverPass that would provide students access to their own personal accounts on the DriverPass network. Make it possible for the administrator to keep an eye on user accounts and adjust their settings so that they remain compliant with any new DMV policies that may be implemented in the future.
Both the planning and execution of activity diagrams are included in this process. It was essential to develop a layout that functioned harmoniously as a whole and made it possible for the reader's eye to be guided across the page. The graphics did not include a large amount of irrelevant or unnecessary information; rather, they portrayed just that which was crucial to the process that was being discussed.
The Use Case diagram that was implemented in “Project 2” may have benefited from some modifications in my end. Both the use of an index to inform the audience of the color that matched to the performer and the use of colors to indicate the numerous actors in the performance would have been things that I would have done differently had I overseen the production.
I made sure to take thorough attendance at all the DriverPass meetings that we conducted and generated a list of everyone who was there. I oversaw compiling a list including all the requirements that we posed to the DriverPass team. Because of this, I was able to ensure that no request was neglected and that everyone's needs were met. To reduce the amount of time spent planning and preparing, it was of the utmost importance to include all the needs in the project. Increasing the team's overall productivity while working on product development.
Even if there are a lot of other important aspects to producing software, the most important one is the discipline of revising existing code. displaying every piece of data and making modifications to it as required up to the point when everything is clear and concise. avoiding the possibility of there being any misunderstanding about the specifics of the request that is being made. Only for the purpose of conducting a system analysis is this being done. For us to have a clear mental picture of the finished product, we absolutely need access to a broad range of different kinds of instruments. Diagrams play a significant role in each of these projects' development, for instance. Putting your thoughts down on paper is a good first step, but it's also beneficial to have something to look at so you can see how everything connects to one another.
